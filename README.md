# Social Media Gaming

The very first video game I coded. I used p5.js. Play it on a computer at http://educationalgaming.org/

It is actually a **proof of concept** that music composers can now be **paid** for each stream of their music each time a video game is played at **no cost to the player**. 
More widely, it shows that you can monetize any content online by using the Musicoin platform's music player on auto play. 

In April 2018, Chrome removed the ability to use music players on autoplay when a web page loads before the viewer interacts with the page. Therefore I created a new code to trigger the Musicoin player when the user hits 'enter' to play the game on my welcome page!

# Unique features
